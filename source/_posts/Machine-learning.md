# Note

## Two Types of machine learning

* The two main types of machine learning are Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning. Supervise learning is used most in real-world applications and has seen the most rapid advancements and innovation. Reinforcement learning is brief.

* Supervised learning need x and **label y**. Learn from data labeled with the right answer. Two major types of machine learning is Regression and Classification.
* Unsupervised learning finding something interesting(structure or pattern) in unlabeled data. Such as Clustering algorithm and Anomaly detection(Find unusual data points) Dimensionality reduction(Compress data using fewer numbers).
